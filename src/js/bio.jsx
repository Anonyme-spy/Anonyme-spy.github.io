                Javascript along with ReactJs offer a unique opportunity to
                narrow your focus and remove clutter during web-development.
                This opportunity facilitates learning and is why I've chosen to
                focus on Javascript, ReactJS, and it's various frameworks
                (expressJS, AngularJS, etc.)

                pain of losing a 50/50 and the pain of your code who doesn't
                want to work. Discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs
                tonnes.” During my studies and my life I have learned the
                importance of discipline. Still inexperienced, I am eager to
                learn and grow.
